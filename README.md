# hello-world
The time-honored traditional project of making a thing say hi.

I'm learning Git directly from the supplied tutorials. I'm used to Perforce and P4V from my previous job,
and I'd like to use Git as my personal code repository and versioning system. Not to mention, placing
code samples here so that they are visible would be nice, career-wise.

I'm looking forward to possibly working with other people here on open-source projects, and maybe
learning new things from people who may make branches on mine.

I'm very well versed in Python and C#, mostly, and will be doing some Unity projects very soon.
I learned coding via Java and HTML, and will be attempting more projects in those languages as well.
I am -very- interested in working in Ruby. I also have a bit of experience in mobile and
video game console (mostly XBoxOne) test automation using Appium, Selenium, and the Microsoft-supplied
software for controlling and automating the XB1. I like automating repetitive tasks for myself using Sikuli.

I'll be doing my own artwork and music for my Unity project, incidentally. I have a BFA in Fine Arts Studio!
I'm pretty good at working in Illustrator, Photoshop, Paint Tool Sai, Krita, and a few other similar softwares.
I've learned a bit about animation as well, and have worked in Final Cut, Premiere, After Effects, and Animate/Flash.

If you're reading this, it's nice to meet you, anonymous stranger!
